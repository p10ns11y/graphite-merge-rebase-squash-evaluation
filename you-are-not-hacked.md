If you notice a different GPG key ID linked to your verified signature, take a moment to reflect on how the merge (or commit) occurred. Consider who the actor was—whether it was you directly or an automated system acting on your behalf—before jumping to conclusions. Here is the conversation with ChatGPT debunking the fear or confusion:

### User:
Does GitHub use auto-generated GPG internally for the user when signing, and does it involve history changes?

### Assistant:
GitHub doesn't automatically generate GPG keys for users when signing commits. Instead, users must manually generate and add their own GPG key for signing commits. Here's how GPG signing and commit history are related in GitHub:

1. **GPG Key Generation**: Users generate their own GPG key using tools like `gpg` or services that provide GPG key management. After generating the key, the public part of the key is added to their GitHub account for verification purposes.

2. **Signing Commits**: Once a GPG key is associated with a user account, the user can sign their commits by configuring Git on their local machine to use the generated GPG key. Signed commits are verified by GitHub, and a "Verified" badge will appear next to the commit if the signature matches the GPG key on GitHub.

3. **History Changes**: GPG signing itself does not alter the history of a repository. However, if you retroactively try to sign older commits (e.g., by rewriting history using `git rebase -i` or `git filter-branch` to add signatures), it **will alter commit hashes** because the commit signature is part of the commit metadata. This can result in changes to the Git history. If this is done in a shared repository, it may cause issues like diverging branches, forcing collaborators to rebase or reset their local branches.

So while GitHub does not auto-generate GPG keys, manual use of GPG for signing commits can lead to history changes if retroactively applied.

### User:
I mean when the user uses GitHub.com's UI such as rebase and merge when merging PRs.

### Assistant:
When you use GitHub.com's UI features like **rebase and merge** for pull requests (PRs), GitHub does not automatically generate a GPG signature for you or modify your commit signatures. However, there are key details to understand about GPG signing and GitHub’s UI features:

### 1. **Rebase and Merge in GitHub UI**:
   - When you use the **"Rebase and merge"** option in GitHub’s UI to merge a pull request, GitHub will rebase the PR branch commits onto the base branch.
   - The original commit hashes will change because rebase rewrites the commit history. This is normal behavior for rebase and isn't related to GPG signing.
   - GitHub does not automatically sign commits during this process. Any commit signing that was done before the rebase (e.g., local commits signed by a user) will remain intact, but new commits generated by the rebase itself will not be signed by default unless done manually in a local repository.

### 2. **GPG Signing of Commits**:
   - If a user has GPG-signed their commits locally and then submits a PR, those commits will retain their signatures through the rebase (but the commit hashes will change).
   - GitHub itself does not automatically add GPG signatures during merges or rebases when using the UI. Users must handle GPG signing locally before pushing the commits.
   
### 3. **History Changes**:
   - **Rebase** inherently rewrites commit history by changing the commit hashes. If the commits were originally signed, their signatures would still be valid after the rebase, but the hashes (and therefore the commit identifiers) will change.
   - This is not specific to GPG signing, but rather a characteristic of rebasing itself.

In summary, GitHub’s UI actions like "rebase and merge" do not involve automatic GPG signing, and they do change commit history by altering commit hashes, but only due to the rebasing process itself, not because of GPG key management.

### User:
Right. When I did squash and merge and simple merge, I noticed the GPG Key ID is different since the commit is created from GitHub server to the main branch. How does it work?

### Assistant:
When you use GitHub's **"Squash and merge"** or **"Merge"** options from the web UI, the resulting commit is created by GitHub's server. This is why the **GPG Key ID** associated with the commit might differ from your local GPG key. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Commits Created on GitHub's Server**:
   - When you choose "Squash and merge" or "Merge" via GitHub’s UI, GitHub creates a **new commit** on your behalf on the **main branch**.
   - Since this commit is generated by GitHub's servers (not your local machine), it is **signed by GitHub's GPG key** instead of your personal GPG key.
   - GitHub uses an internal GPG key to sign commits made via the web interface or automated processes, giving them a "Verified" status.

### 2. **GPG Key for Web Interface Commits**:
   - The GPG key associated with these server-generated commits is not your personal key but one managed by GitHub. The GPG signature for these commits will use GitHub’s GPG key.
   - GitHub's GPG key used for these operations is publicly available and can be verified by anyone. It ensures that the commit is trusted and was created by the GitHub system on your behalf.
   
### 3. **GPG Signatures for Different Merge Strategies**:
   - **Squash and Merge**: All commits in the pull request are squashed into a **single new commit**. Since this commit is created by GitHub, it uses GitHub's GPG signature.
   - **Rebase and Merge**: Each commit in the pull request is rebased onto the base branch, and the commit hashes change. If the original commits were GPG signed, their signatures are retained. If they weren’t signed, no signatures are added.
   - **Simple Merge**: This creates a merge commit without changing the commit history (no rebasing or squashing). The merge commit itself is created by GitHub’s server, so it will use GitHub’s GPG key for the merge commit.

### 4. **Why GitHub Uses Its Own GPG Key**:
   - When commits or merges are performed via the GitHub UI, they are executed by GitHub's backend system rather than your local machine.
   - To provide integrity and authenticity for these server-generated commits, GitHub signs them using its own GPG key, so that users can verify the commit was indeed created by GitHub's system.

### 5. **What You See in the Commit Log**:
   - For server-generated commits, the **GPG signature** will show GitHub’s key ID (e.g., `GitHub <noreply@github.com>`), and you’ll see a "Verified" label in the GitHub UI. This indicates that the commit was signed by GitHub.
   - Your personal GPG key will only be applied to commits that you create and sign locally before pushing to GitHub.

In short, when using **squash and merge** or **simple merge** via GitHub, the GPG key belongs to GitHub because the server creates the final commit. This is how GitHub ensures the authenticity and verification of server-side commits.
